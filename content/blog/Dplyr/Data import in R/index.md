### Importing Data

 ## CSV Files:
 
- Import a CSV file

data <- read.csv("path/to/your/file.csv")
print(head(data))  # Display the first few rows of the data
 
 ## Excel Files (using the readxl package):

 - Install and load the readxl package

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

- Import an Excel file

data <- read_excel("path/to/your/file.xlsx", sheet = 1)
print(head(data))

 ## Text Files:

- Import a tab-delimited text file
data <- read.table("path/to/your/file.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
print(head(data))

    - Other Formats: R has packages like haven for SPSS, SAS, and Stata files and jsonlite for JSON data.

 - Export a data frame to a CSV file

write.csv(data, "path/to/your/output.csv", row.names = FALSE)
